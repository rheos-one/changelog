But first, breakfast with the parental at the local cult.

Fried bird bits in oil for the first time today.  
There was alcohol and potatos and gravy and deviled eggs.  
So often, our chosen family supports us better than blood or biology.

Navigated a new house, drove multiple times, and only needed one dose of caffiene...and this is *after* working most of the night prepping paperwork, napping at the office, and the breakfast with the parental.

Checkin with documentation lead on next steps.
Gained buy-in from documentation and frontend recruit.
Clarified meta-repo purpose and division of work for establishing necessary structure.
Obtained quote for two bare-metal backend server options.
Pruned work priorities and set work-end conditions for copyedit lead.

Extended conversation into the truth mapper, along with a deep dive into project governance and the process of relinquishing control.

Identified three potential developers for the project, two backend primaries and one frontend primary, and established LaTeX as the 'publishing' documentation paradigm, with Markdown and Dia used for development and graphical representation of information, respectively.

# 2019.08.29 Changelog
Met with documentation lead to discuss path forward.
Obtained buy-in for infrastructure offering meta, deferred prototype selection to end-of-day.

Load balancer spec agreed upon, as a precursor for any/all auto-scaling infrastructure.

Added numeric flag to functions.sh `com/namer.sh` subfunction.
@todo - update defaults for `com/namer.sh` to length of 5, with numeric division for clarity.
(possible combinations from these defaults increase from `392882600736521` (`73241*73241*73241`) to `3.92882600736521e16` (`73241*10*73241*10*73241`), which is...probably excessive, but format of `numberal3split5words` is easier to remember, and the function will be used to name the automated infrastructure)

Created Github org for Rheos One.
Need to get profile IDs for team members.
